    "1.A key factor that makes the difference between ideas that can, and cannot be examined and tested statistically is is the availability of data, an idea becomes hypothesis only if there is data that can evaluate it. A key criteria defining what good null hypothesis is it must represent the status quo or baseline assumption that can be tested through statistical methods. It should be a clear, testable statement about a population parameter, often involving an equality for example :'the mean salary is $113000' The null hypothesis H0 assumes no effect or no difference the mean salary is $113000. It is the hypothesis that we aim to test. The alternative hypothesis H1 or Ha represents everything else that contradicts the null 'the mean salary is not $113000'. It reflects the potential for change or deviation from the null."

    "3.When we calculate a p-value, we assume the null hypothesis is true because we want to see how likely our observed data would be in that situation. The sampling distribution of the test statistic shows what we expect to see if the null hypothesis is correct. The p-value then tells us how extreme or unusual our observed result is compared to this expected outcome. If our data is far from what we'd expect under the null hypothesis, it suggests the null hypothesis might not be true."

The test statistic, which measures how far our data is from the expected outcome under the null hypothesis, is compared to the sampling distribution. If the test statistic is extreme‚Äîmeaning it's far from the average of what we'd expect‚Äîthen the p-value will be small. This suggests the null hypothesis doesn't fit well with the data, and we might reject it in favor of the alternative hypothesis."

    "5.To simulate a p-value, we assume the null hypothesis H0 is true, meaning no preference for left or right head tilts. We model this by flipping a coin for 124 couples (50/50 chance for left or right) and repeat this many times. The p-value is the proportion of simulations where 80 or more couples tilt right, just like in the study. If the p-value is large, the result is likely due to chance. If it's small  for example p < 0.05it suggests there's a real tendency to tilt right, giving us evidence against H0.\n"
