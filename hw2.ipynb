    "The provided code implements and extends a Markovian Chatbot that predicts the next word based on previous words using two approaches: unigram (single word) and bigram (word pair) models.\n",

    "Part 1: Simple Markovian Chatbot (Unigram Model)\n",
    "Goal: Predict the next word based on the current word.\n",
    "Logic:\n",
    "word_used tracks how often each word occurs.\n",
    "next_word stores how often each word is followed by another word.\n",
    "The loop iterates through the word list (excluding the last word) to update these dictionaries and build a simple transition model for word prediction.\n",
    "Part 2: Advanced Markovian Chatbot (Bigram Model)\n",
    "Goal: Predict the next word based on the previous two words (bigram).\n",
    "Logic:\n",
    "The chatbot now considers both a pair of previous words (bigram) and the character speaking (from a dataset) to predict the next word.\n",
    "Nested dictionaries word_used2C and next_word2C store word pairs and their transitions, tracked separately for each character.\n",
    "This approach improves context awareness, allowing more specific and coherent sentence generation.\n",
    "Key Improvements with Bigram:\n",
    "Better Context: By considering two words, the chatbot generates more accurate and contextually relevant predictions.\n",
    "Character-Specific Predictions: The model tailors predictions to individual characters, adding personality to the chatbot's responses.\n",
    "Overall Impact:\n",
    "The code evolves from a simple model that predicts based on one word to a more sophisticated system that uses bigrams, improving sentence coherence and prediction accuracy.\n",

And in another chatgpt session, I asked the code \"for, i word in enumerate(words[:-1]): \"and chatgpt helped me to understand that the loop goes through all the words in the list experct the last one, it pairs the word with the word that next to this word and the reason to ignore the last word is because there are no words behind the last word.\n",
